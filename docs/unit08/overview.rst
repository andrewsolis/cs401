Unit 8: Database Management
===========================

Storing information for retrieval later on is a key part of any application.
Databases allow software systems to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently.
In this unit, we will explore the fundamentals of databases,
including how to design and implement them,
as well as how to interact with them using SQL (Structured Query Language).
We'll also look at how we can interact with them in Python,
and how to setup a database for an example web application.

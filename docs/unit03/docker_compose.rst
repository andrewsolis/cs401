Docker Compose
==============

Up to this point, we have been looking at single-container applications - small
units of code that are containerized, executed *ad hoc* to generate or read a file, 
then exit on completion. But what if we want to do something more
complex? For example, what if our goal is to orchestrate a multi-container
application consisting of, e.g., a Flask app, a database, a front-end service, 
and more.

**Docker compose** is a tool for managing multi-container applications. A YAML
file is used to define all of the application service, and a few simple commands
can be used to spin up or tear down all of the services.

In this module, we will get a first look at Docker compose. After going
through this module, students should be able to:

* Translate Docker run commands into YAML files for Docker compose
* Run commands inside *ad hoc* containers using Docker compose
* Manage small software systems composed of more than one script, and more than
  one container
* Copy data into and out of containers as needed


Another Script, Another Container
---------------------------------

We have been working a lot with a script for reading in and analyzing a
simple text file. Let's quickly write a new script to
generate that data, then we will package it into its own container. Consider the
following script for **generating** sample number like we have
been working with:

.. code-block:: python3
   :linenos:

   #!/usr/bin/env python3

   import random
   import sys
   import names

   '''
   Collatz Generator Code for CS 401

   Author: Andrew Solis
   '''

   NUM = 20

   def main():


      for i in range(NUM):

         rand_num = random.randint(1, 1000)

         with open(sys.argv[1], 'a') as file:
               file.write( str(rand_num ) + '\n')
         

      print(f'Data written to {sys.argv[1]}')

      print(f'Codename { names.get_first_name() }')

   if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()

.. attention::

   This script requires a python package called **names**. This can be installed from your terminal
   by issuing the command ``pip install names``. If you get an error then you can create a virtual environment
   first by running the following commands: 

      python3 -m venv venv
      
      # linux/mac  

      source venv/bin/activate
      
      # Windows
      
      venv\\Scripts\\activate

   Then you can install the package with the command ``pip install names``. If you do not know 
   what virtual environments are do not worry, we will cover them later in this course. If you
   are still having issues then reach other to the professor for help. 

Copy that into a file called ``gen_collatz.py``, save it, make it executable, and
test it. You'll find that this script requires a **command line argument**. Meaning
we have to invoke it AND pass some information on the command line in order to get
it to work. In this case, it is expecting the name of the output file.

.. code-block:: console

   # copy contents into file called ``gen_collatz.py`` and save
   [terminal]$ chmod +rx gen_collatz.py
   [terminal]$ python gen_collatz.py
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "./gen_collatz.py", line 29, in <module>
       main()
     File "./gen_collatz.py", line 25, in main
       with open(sys.argv[1], 'w') as o:
   IndexError: list index out of range

   # need to provide output filename on command line
   [terminal]$ python gen_collatz.py data.txt
   Data written to data.txt.
   Codename Sharon
   [terminal]$ ls
   data.txt  Dockerfile  gen_collatz.py  input.txt  collatz.py
   [terminal]$ head -n11 data.txt
   409
   1
   371
   622
   6
   229
   617
   236
   778
   165
   306

Containerizing this script should be easy enough - we already worked through
containerizing another very similar script. But, lets say we need a different dependency: the Python3
``names`` library.

To make things a little more clear, rename the existing Dockerfile as
``Dockerfile-program``, and make a copy of it called ``Dockerfile-gen``.

.. code-block:: console

   [terminal]$ mv Dockerfile Dockerfile-program
   [terminal]$ cp Dockerfile-program Dockerfile-gen
   [terminal]$ ls
   Dockerfile-gen     Dockerfile-program collatz.py         
   data.txt           gen_collatz.py     input.txt

Edit ``Dockerfile-gen`` as follows:

.. code-block:: Dockerfile
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 16,18,20

   FROM ubuntu:20.04

   RUN apt-get update && \
      apt-get upgrade -y && \
      apt-get install -y curl git vim 
      
   RUN DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y software-properties-common 

   RUN add-apt-repository -y ppa:deadsnakes/ppa

   RUN apt-get install -y python3.12

   RUN curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py && \
      python3.12 get-pip.py

   RUN pip install names

   COPY gen_collatz.py /code/gen_collatz.py

   RUN chmod +rx /code/gen_collatz.py

   ENV PATH="/code:$PATH"



Now that we have a Dockerfile named something other than the default name, we
need to modify our command line a little bit to build it:

.. code-block:: console

   [terminal]$ docker build -t username/gen_collatz:1.0 -f Dockerfile-gen .

After the image is successfully built, change directories to a new folder just
to be sure you are not running the local scripts or looking at the local data.
Then, test the container as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   [terminal]$ mkdir test
   [terminal]$ cd test
   [terminal]$ ls
   [terminal]$ docker run --rm username/gen_collatz:1.0 gen_collatz.py data.txt
   Data written to data.txt
   Codename Alex

If you list your local files, can you find ``data.txt``? No! This is because
whatever data generated inside the container is lost when the container
completes its task. What we need to do is use the ``-v`` flag to mount a directory
somewhere inside the container, write data into that directory, then the data will
be captured after the container exists. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   [terminal]$ docker run --rm -v $PWD:/data username/gen_collatz:1.0 gen_collatz.py /data/data.txt
   Data written to data.txt.
   Codename Sandra

.. note::

   To reiterate, because we mounted our current location as a folder called "/data"
   (``-v $PWD:/data``), and we made sure to write the output file to that location in
   the container (``gen_collatz.py /data/data.txt``), then we get to keep the file
   after the container exits, and it shows up in our current location (``$PWD``).

EXERCISE
~~~~~~~~

Spend a few minutes testing both containers. Be sure you can generate data with
one container, then read in and analyze the same data with the other. Data needs
to persist outside the containers in order to do this.



Write a Compose File
--------------------

Docker compose works by interpreting rules declared in a YAML file (typically
called ``docker-compose.yml``). The rules we will write will replace the
``docker run`` commands we have been using, and which have been growing quite
complex. For example, the commands we used to run our JSON parsing scripts in a
container looked like the following:

.. code-block:: console

   [terminal]$ docker run --rm -v $PWD:/data username/gen_collatz:1.0 gen_collatz.py /data/data.txt
   [terminal]$ docker run --rm -v $PWD/data.txt:/data/data.txt username/collatz:1.0 collatz.py /data/data.txt

The above ``docker run`` commands can be loosely translated into a YAML file.
Navigate to the folder that contains your Python scripts and Dockerfiles, then
create a new empty file called ``docker-compose.yml``:

.. code-block:: console

   [terminal]$ pwd
   /home/asolis/docker-exercise
   [terminal]$ touch docker-compose.yml
   [terminal]$ ls
   Dockerfile-gen     collatz.py         docker-compose.yml
   Dockerfile-program gen_collatz.py     test/


Next, open up ``docker-compose.yml`` with your favorite text editor and type /
paste in the following text:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 9,19

   ---

   services:
      gen-data:
         build:
               context: ./
               dockerfile: ./Dockerfile-gen
         image: username/gen_collatz:1.0
         volumes:
               - ./test:/data
         command: gen_collatz.py /data/data.txt
      analyze-data:
         build:
               context: ./
               dockerfile: ./Dockerfile-program
         depends_on:
               - gen-data
         image: username/collatz:1.0
         volumes:
               - ./test:/data
         command: collatz.py /data/data.txt


.. warning::

   The highlighted lines above may need to be edited with your username in order for this to work. 
   See instructions below.


The ``version`` key must be included and simply denotes that we are using
version 3 of Docker compose.

.. note::
   You may receive an error saying that the ``version`` key is obsolete and can safely be removed.

The ``services`` section defines the configuration of individual container
instances that we want to orchestrate. In our case, we define two called
``gen-data`` for the gen_collatz functionality, and ``analyze-data`` for
the collatz program functionality.

Each of those services is configured with its own Docker image,
a mounted volume (equivalent to the ``-v`` option for ``docker run``), and a default
command to run.


.. note::

   The top-level ``services`` keyword shown above is just one important part of
   Docker compose. To learn about aboth important parts of a compose file 
   please visit the `Docker Compose Docs <https://docs.docker.com/compose/>`_.


Running Docker Compose
----------------------

The Docker compose command line tool follows the same syntax as other Docker
commands:

.. code-block:: console

   docker compose <verb> <parameters>

Just like Docker, you can pass the ``--help`` flag to ``docker compose`` or to
any of the verbs to get additional usage information. To get started on the
command line tools, try issuing the following two commands:

.. code-block:: console

   [terminal]$ docker compose version
   [terminal]$ docker compose config

The first command prints the version of Docker compose installed, and the second
searches your current directory for ``docker compose.yml`` and checks that it
contains only valid syntax.

To run one of these services, use the ``docker compose run`` verb, and pass the
name of the service as defined in your YAML file:

.. code-block:: console

   [terminal]$ ls test/     # currently empty
   [terminal]$ docker compose run gen-data
   Data written to /data/data.txt.
   Codename Alice.
   [terminal]$ ls test/
   data.txt               # new file!
   [terminal]$ docker compose run analyze-data
   Collatz
   =======
   ...


Now we have an easy way to run our *ad hoc* services consistently and
reproducibly. Not only does ``docker compose.yml`` make it easier to run our
services, it also represents a record of how we intend to interact with this
container.

**Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities Students Should Have Before Entering This Course:**

This course assumes familiarity with the Python programming language and strong
working knowledge of basic, high-level language programming concepts including
data structures, conditionals, loops, and functions. We also assume a basic,
working knowledge of the Linux command line. We will briefly review programming
concepts in Linux and Python during the first week of class, the first homework
assignment will be based on these topics, and we will make every effort to help
students who are less familiar with these concepts. Ultimately, each student is
expected to and responsible for mastering this material. This is not an
introductory programming class and we will not have time to give a comprehensive
treatment of all of these topics.


**Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities Students Gain from this Course (Learning Outcomes):**

The objective of this course is to introduce students to advanced computing
concepts in software engineering, software systems design, cloud computing,
distributed systems, and computational engineering. Through a series of
assignments spanning the course of the semester, students will build a
cloud-based, computational system to interact with a time series data set
and provide a web-accessible interface to their system.

https://data.nasa.gov/browse) representing other select Criterion (A-L) relevant
to the ABET program accreditation. The exact data sets and types of data will
depend on individual student interests.


**Professionalism Topics:**

Throughout the course, students will be taught to communicate professionally in
the documentation of their software and in their software engineering & design
projects. Effective communication in software projects is necessary to inform
other engineers about the purpose or function of the project, and how to use it.
Students will form teams to work together on the Final Projects (see description
below) and will be required to address ethical and professional responsibilities
in the course of working on their project.


**Design Assignments (Final Project Description):**

The Final Project will be a culmination of all materials covered in the class.
Students will build a cloud-based, computational system to interact with a time
series data set and provide a web-accessible interface to their system. Prior to
working on the Final Project, students will form teams to work through a “design”
phase where they must identify a primary data set to work on, describe API
endpoints, diagram architecture components, and draft other major documentation
components. In addition, students will be required to write in their own words
what they think their ethical and professional responsibilities are as an
engineer and how that relates to the Final Project. The project design will be
pitched to the instructors and given feedback / subject to approval. The Final
Project will be due at the end of the semester in the form of a written report
(e.g. pdf) and a GitHub repository containing the software and all support files.
The full Final Project description will be posted on the class webpage.


**Computer:**

The entire course will be computer based. The instructors will provide a remote
server for students to work on. Students are expected to have access to a
personal / lab computer with a web browser and a terminal (or SSH client).


**Text:**

No textbook will be used for this course.


**Class Format:**

The class will be delivered in person in a computer lab setting. Most class
meetings will be comprised of lectures/demonstrations and hands-on labs. Students
are expected to attend every lecture and actively participate in the hands-on
labs during the class. The hands-on portions will often solve parts of homework
assignments. Lecture materials with worked examples will be posted to the class
website right before the class meeting. Additionally, there will be a class Slack
channel for discussing ideas about the course with your fellow students.

* 50% Homework - Approximately 8-10 coding / software design assignments to be
  submitted via GitHub.
* 20% Midterm - A midterm design project will include concepts from the first
  half of the semester and build on the first 4-5 homework assignments. A
  written component will also be required.
* 30% Final Project - Students will form groups to work on a final class project
  consisting of a distributed, web-accessible, cloud system to interact with a
  time series data set. The project will draw from and build upon work done
  throughout the semester in homework assignments. The project will need to be
  pitched to the instructors for approval, and a written component will also be
  required.

(See syllabus for letter grade cutoffs)

**Homework Policy:**

We encourage collaboration on homework assignments. Engaging in discussions
and comparing notes with other students about the homework assignments can
be a valuable learning experience. However, each student is expected to complete
and turn in their own homework assignment. We do not allow students to copy
directly from others.

All homework assignments will be turned in as Git repositories on GitHub. 
Homework repositories should be set to private, and shared with the course 
instructor. The course instructor will pull homework from the repositories at 
the posted due date / time. Instructions on setting up the repositories and 
sharing them with the course instructor will be covered in class.


**Attendance:**

Regular attendance is expected but absences will not count against the student’s
grades. We expect students to give us a week notice in advance of their absence
if known ahead of time.


**Office Hours:**

Office hours will be for 1 hour immediately following the class and/or by
appointment. We plan to use Slack for general communications and to help with
the materials. https://tacc-learn.slack.com/


**Important Dates:**

Please refer to UT's academic calendar for important dates:
https://registrar.utexas.edu/calendars/23-24 


**Special Notes:**

The University of Texas at Austin provides upon request appropriate academic
adjustments for qualified students with disabilities. For more information,
contact the Office of the Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TDD or the

**Honor Code:**

The University of Texas at Austin strives to create a dynamic and engaging 
community of teaching and learning where students feel intellectually challenged; 
build knowledge and skills; and develop critical thinking, creativity, and 
intellectual curiosity. As a part of this community, it is important to engage in 
assignments, exams, and other work for your classes with openness, integrity, and 
a willingness to make mistakes and learn from them. The UT Austin honor code 
champions these principles:

* I pledge, as a member of the University of Texas community, to do my work honestly, 
  respectfully, and through the intentional pursuit of learning and scholarship.

The honor code affirmation includes three additional principles that elaborate on 
the core theme:

* I pledge to be honest about what I create and to acknowledge what I use that 
  belongs to others.
* I pledge to value the process of learning in addition to the outcome, while 
  celebrating and learning from mistakes.
* This code encompasses all of the academic and scholarly endeavors of the university
  community.

The honor code is more than a set of rules, it reflects the values that are 
foundational to your academic community. By affirming and embracing the honor 
code, you are both upholding the integrity of your work and contributing to a campus 
culture of trust and respect.


**Academic Integrity Expectations:**

Students who violate University rules on academic misconduct are subject to 
the student conduct process. A student found responsible for academic misconduct 
may be assigned both a status sanction and a grade impact for the course. The 
grade impact could range from a zero on the assignment in question up to a 
failing grade in the course. A status sanction can range from a written warning, 
probation, deferred suspension and/or dismissal from the University. To learn 
more about academic integrity standards, tips for avoiding a potential academic 
misconduct violation, and the overall conduct process, please visit the Student 
Conduct and Academic Integrity website at: http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct.


**Artificial Intelligence:**

The creation of artificial intelligence tools for widespread use is an exciting 
innovation. These tools have both appropriate and inappropriate uses in classwork. 
The use of artificial intelligence tools (such as ChatGPT) in this class shall 
be permitted on a limited basis. You will be informed as to the assignments for 
which AI may be utilized. You are also welcome to seek my prior-approval to use 
AI writing tools on any assignment. In either instance, AI writing tools should 
be used with caution and proper citation, as the use of AI should be properly 
attributed. Using AI writing tools without my permission or authorization, or 
failing to properly cite AI even where permitted, shall constitute a violation of 
UT Austin's Institutional Rules on academic integrity. If you are considering the 
use of AI writing tools but are unsure if you are allowed or the extent to which 
they may be utilized appropriately, please ask.

**Religious Holy Days:**

By UT Austin policy, you must notify me of your pending absence for a religious 
holy day as far in advance as possible of the date of observance. If you must 
miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe 
a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed 
work within a reasonable time after the absence.


**Names and Pronouns:**

Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student's legal name, 
unless they have added a chosen name with the registrar's office. If you have 
not yet done so, I will gladly honor your request to address you with the name 
and pronouns that you prefer for me to use for you. It is helpful to advise me 
of any changes or needs regarding your name and pronouns early in the semester 
so that I may make appropriate updates to my records and be informed about how 
to support you in this class. 

* For instructions on how to add your pronouns to Canvas, visit this site. 
* If you would like to update your chosen name with the registrar's office, 
  you can do so here, and reference this guide.
* For additional guidelines prepared by the Gender and Sexuality Center for 
  changing your name on various campus systems, see the Resources page under UT 
  Resources here.


**TITLE IX DISCLOSURE**

Beginning January 1, 2020, Texas Education Code, Section 51.252 (formerly 
known as Senate Bill 212) requires all employees of Texas universities, including 
faculty, to report to the Title IX Office any information regarding incidents 
of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, or stalking that is 
disclosed to them. Texas law requires that all employees who witness or receive 
information about incidents of this type (including, but not limited to, written 
forms, applications, one-on-one conversations, class assignments, class discussions, 
or third-party reports) must report it to the Title IX Coordinator. Before 
talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX-related 
incident, please remember that I will be required to report this information.

Although graduate teaching and research assistants are not subject to Texas 
Education Code, Section 51.252, they are mandatory reporters under federal 
Title IX regulations and are required to report a wide range of behaviors we 
refer to as sexual misconduct, including the types of misconduct covered under 
Texas Education Code, Section 51.252. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 
1972 is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis 
of sex - including pregnancy and parental status - in educational programs and 
activities. The Title IX Office has developed supportive ways and compiled 
campus resources to support all impacted by a Title IX matter.

If you would like to speak with a case manager, who can provide support, resources, 
or academic accommodations, in the Title IX Office, please email:  supportandresources@austin.utexas.edu. 
Case managers can also provide support, resources, and accommodations for pregnant, 
nursing, and parenting students.

For more information about reporting options and resources, please visit: https://titleix.utexas.edu, 
contact the Title IX Office via email at: titleix@austin.utexas.edu, or call 512-471-0419.


**Campus Safety**

The following are recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from the
Office of Emergency Management, 512-232-2114: 

* Students should sign up for Campus Emergency Text Alerts at the page linked 
  above.
* Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus must 
  evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or 
  announcement requires exiting and assembling outside.
* Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building 
  you may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you 
  used when entering the building.
* Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor 
  in writing during the first week of class.
* In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class 
  instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the 
  following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police 
  Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
* For more information, please visit the Office of Emergency Management.

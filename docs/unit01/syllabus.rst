**Catalog Description**
------------------------

This course will introduce the concepts, principles, techniques, standards and best practices, 
and methods of software engineering to design and develop high-quality and cost-effective software
products and systems. This course will utilize computer architecture, data structures, 
and object-oriented approaches. Students in this course will learn an overview 
to design and develop software products and systems; software life cycle; specifications; 
cost and effort estimation; and tools to effectively analyze, design, test, and maintain software.

**Course Overview**
-------------------

This course is an introduction to software engineering concepts and the design of software systems. 
Through a semester long process, students will learn how to build a software system like products 
created in the real world. Students will explore different software ideas including version control, 
containers, APIs, web development, and database management.


**Program Learning Outcomes**
-----------------------------

Upon completion of the undergraduate B.S. program in Data Science, Analytics & Visualization, students will be able to:

1.	Describe foundational computer organization, architecture, computing resources, and systems;
2.	Describe foundational mathematical concepts and operations towards design, development, and analysis of applications;
3.	Apply programming language towards application development;
4.	Integrate an awareness of ethical issues and collective standards to positively influence the application of data science to service, justice and peace in working towards solutions for societal problems.

**Alignment of Natural Sciences Courses with Marianist and Hawaiian values of the University**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Natural Sciences Division provides an integral, quality education: sophisticated integrative course content taught by experienced, dedicated, and well-educated instructors.

- *We educate in family spirit* – every classroom is an Ohana and you can expect to be respected yet challenged in an environment that is supportive, inclusively by instructors who take the time to personally get to know and care for you.
- *We educate for service, justice and peace*, since many of the most pressing global issues (climate change, health inequity, poverty, justice) are those which science and technology investigate, establish ethical parameters for, and offer solutions to.
- *We educate for adaptation and change.* In science and technology, the only constant is change. Data, techniques, technologies, questions, interpretations and ethical landscapes are constantly evolving, and we teach students to thrive on this dynamic uncertainty.

The study of science and technology can be formative, exploring human creativity and potential in the development of technologies and scientific solutions, 
the opportunity to engage in the stewardship of the natural world, and the opportunity to promote social justice. 
We provide opportunities to engage with the problems that face Hawai‘i and the Pacific region through the Natural Sciences curriculum, 
in particular, those centered around severe challenges in health, poverty, environmental resilience, and erosion of traditional culture. 
The Marianist Educational Values relate to Native Hawaiian ideas of *mana, na’auao, ohana, aloha and aina*. 
We intend for our Natural Sciences programs to be culturally-sustaining, rooted in our Hawaiian place, and 
centered on core values of *Maiau*, be neat, prepared, careful in all we do; *Makawalu*, demonstrate foresight and planning; `*Ai*, sustain mind and body; *Pa`a Na`au*, learn deeply.

**Additional departmental and university policies**
---------------------------------------------------

Late Work Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Requests for extensions due to extenuating circumstances (medical problems, for example) will be considered, 
but work received after the deadline will not be graded.
Computer problems are not an excuse for late work.

Students and instructors may negotiate an incomplete grade when there are specific justifying circumstances. 
An Incomplete Contract (available form the Divisional Secretary and the Portal) must be completed. 
When submitting a grade the “I” will be accompanied by the alternative grade that will automatically be assigned after 90 days. 
These include IB, IC, ID, and IF. If only an “I” is submitted the default grade is F. 
The completion of the work, evaluation, and reporting of the final grade is due within 90 days after the end of the semester or term. 
This limit may not be extended.

Students unable to comply will be asked to leave class. Out of consideration for your classmates, 
please set your cell phone to silent mode during class. Students are encouraged to 
bring laptops or tablets to class as the instructor will assign online activities 
and readings that will require the use of a laptop or tablet. Laptops and tablets

Verification of their disability will be requested through appropriate documentation 
and once received it will take up to approximately 2–3 weeks to review them. 
Appropriate paperwork will be completed by the student before notification will 
be sent out to their instructors. Accommodation paperwork will not be automatically 
sent out to instructors each semester, as the student is responsible to

Attendance Policy 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following attendance policy is from the 2024-2025 Academic Catalog: 
Students are expected to attend regularly all courses for which they are 
registered. Student should notify their instructors when illness or other 
extenuating circumstances prevents them from attending class and make 
arrangements to complete missed assignments. Notification may be done 
by emailing the instructor’s Chaminade email address, calling the instructor’s 
campus extension, or by leaving a message with the instructor’s school 
office (Natural Science and Math 1 (808) 440-4204). It is the instructor’s 
prerogative to modify deadlines of course requirements accordingly. 
Any student who stops attending a course without officially withdrawing may receive a failing grade. 

Unexcused absences equivalent to more than a week of classes may lead to a 
grade reduction for the course. Any unexcused absence of two consecutive 
weeks or more may result in being withdrawn from the course by the instructor,
although the instructor is not required to withdraw students in that scenario. 
Repeated absences put students at risk of failing grades. 


Students with disabilities who have obtained accommodations from the Chaminade 
University of Honolulu ADA Coordinator may be considered for an exception when 
the accommodation does not materially alter the attainment of the learning 
outcomes. Federal regulations require continued attendance for continuing 
payment of financial aid. When illness or personal reasons necessitate continued 
absence, the student should communicate first with the instructor to review 
the options. Anyone who stops attending a course without official withdrawal 
may receive a failing grade or be withdrawn by the instructor at the instructor’s discretion.
